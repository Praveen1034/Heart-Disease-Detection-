# **Heart-Disease-Detection** 

•	Developed a machine learning classification model for heart disease prediction.

•	Used Shapiro test for normality, ANOVA for feature selection, Min-Max scaling for data preprocessing, and PCA for performance improvement. Identified SVC as the best model.

•	Achieved 87.3% testing accuracy and 87% AUC, with an 88.2% training accuracy, enhancing predictive capability for heart disease diagnosis.

**Key skills:** Machine Learning, Shapiro Test, ANOVA, Min-Max Scaling, PCA, SVC, Python.
